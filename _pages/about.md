I am an aspiring data scientist with experiences in many areas, but a heavier concentration in Python and R.  I have a masters in applied mathematics which lends itself to an extensive knowledge in the area of statistics and analysis.  I have traveled to other countries, and lived in several states, which contributes to an understanding of diversity and adaptation.  I have been successful in several fields from being a chef in the culinary world, to entertainment, and to teaching mathematics in the field of education.  I have a strong work ethic and insatiable drive to learn and succeed.
